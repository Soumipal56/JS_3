## Level 1 - Pure Beginner Practice
#### 1. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using loop.
#### 2. Print only even numbers from 1 to 20 using loop and conditions to print even ones.
#### 3. Print numbers from 10 to 1 using reverse loop with a decrement.
#### 4. Print the word "yes" 5 times repeat using a loop.
#### 5. Print whether numbers from 1 to 10 are even or odd. For each number check: "even", else -> "odd".
#### 6. Ask user for a number and say if it is positive or negative using prompt() and a condition.
#### 7. Ask user's age and check if eligible to vote. If age >= 18 -> "Eligible", else -> "not eligible".
#### 8. Print multiplication table of 5 using loop to print 5 * 1 to 5 * 10.
#### 9. Count how many numbers between 1 and 15 are greater than 8 using loop and count conditionally.
#### 10. Ask user for password and print access status. Hardcoded correct password. Compare with user input.

## Level 2 - Slightly Tougher but Logical
#### 11. Allow only 3 attempts to enter correct password. If user gets it right early, stop. If not -> "Account locked".
#### 12. Ask user for words until they type "stop". Count how many times they typed "yes" using loop until "stop" is typed. Count "yes".
#### 13. Print numbers divisible by 7 from 1 to 50 using modulo % and loop.
#### 14. Sum of all odd numbers from 1 to 30. Add only odd numbers. Print final sum.
#### 15. Keep asking number until user enters an even number using while loop. Stop only if input is even.
#### 16. Print numbers between two user inputs. Input start and end using prompt() -> print all between.
#### 17. Print only first 3 odd numbers from 1 to 20 using loop. Stop with break after 3 odd prints.
#### 18. Ask user 5 numbers. Count how many are positive using loop + condition + counter.
#### 19. ATM Simulator - Allow 3 withdrawals. Start with Rs 1000 balance. Ask withdrawal amount 3 times.If enough balance -> deduct. Else -> print "Insufficient balance".
